# Machine Learning — Learning from First Principles

This repository documents my journey of learning machine learning step by step, starting from the fundamentals and gradually moving toward more advanced topics and real-world systems.

The focus of this repo is **understanding how things work internally**, not just using libraries as black boxes.

## 🎯 Goal of this repository

- Build a **strong conceptual foundation**
- Understand **why algorithms work**, not just how to call them
- Practice structured thinking around data, models, and systems
- Progress from algorithms → applications → production-ready pipelines

This repo will evolve as my learning progresses.
